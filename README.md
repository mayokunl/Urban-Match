# Urban Match 🏙️

**HackSLU 2026 Project**

Urban Match is a personalized city-planning platform designed to help people discover opportunities, housing, and lifestyle experiences in **St. Louis**.  

Instead of guessing whether a city fits your life, Urban Match helps users **plan their future based on their income, goals, and interests**.

---

## 🚨 Problem

St. Louis is experiencing **population decline**.  

Many people avoid moving to the city because:
- They believe there is **nothing to do**
- It is difficult to find **jobs and opportunities**
- Housing options feel **unclear or disconnected**
- There is no **central platform** to plan life in the city

As a result, people leave or never consider St. Louis in the first place.

---

## 💡 Solution

Urban Match acts as a **life-planning engine for cities**.

Users input:
- Expected salary

Finally, it provides a **personalized recommendation** showing how well St. Louis fits the user’s lifestyle.
